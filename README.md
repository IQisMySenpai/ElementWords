## Disclaimer

I know this table is great for rainbow attacks.

But please only use it for ethical hacking. Only use this if you have permission from the owner of the target you are hacking.

Since this is the internet and a simple disclaimer won't stop hackers using my code or lists, I won't take any claim for damages etc. as mentioned in the license.
